# tensorflow-tutorial2018

## Introduction ##
This is a beginner's tensorflow tutorial based on ipython notebook.
I used this material at tensorflow tutorial @ kurohashi-kawahara lab in Kyoto University.

## Requirements ##
tensorflow,
jupyter,
ipdb (for debugging)

## What to do first ##
Check following commands before the lecture.

```
git clone https://github.com/shuheikurita/tensorflow-tutorial2018
cd tensorflow-tutorial2018
virtualenv tensorflow -p python3 --no-site-packages
source tensorflow/bin/activate
pip install tensorflow
# pip install tensorflow-gpu  ## for GPU usage.
pip install ipdb ## for debugger
```

Our tasks will be done on the Jupyter notebook:
```
pip install jupyter
jupyter notebook
```
. Open the link`http://localhost:8888/?token=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX (specified on the termial)` on your Chrome browser. (Firefox might work. I recommend either Chrome or Firefox.)
Ask me if you cannot launch the Jupyter notebook before the lecture.

Open *tutorial.ipynb* for the lecture.
